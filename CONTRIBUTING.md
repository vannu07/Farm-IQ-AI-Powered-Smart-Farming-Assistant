# 🌾🧑‍💻 Contributing to Farm-IQ: The AI Farming Assistant

**Welcome!** We're thrilled you're interested in contributing to Farm-IQ! This project aims to bring the power of AI to smart farming, and your help is vital.

🥳 **This repository proudly participates in Hacktoberfest!** We encourage all skill levels to get involved, whether you're a Python coder, a data scientist, or a technical writer.

***

## 📚 Getting Started

Before you begin contributing, please:

1. **Read the [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md)** - Learn how to set up the project locally
2. **Review the [API Documentation](API_DOCUMENTATION.md)** - Understand the endpoints and functionality
3. **Check the [README](README.md)** - Get familiar with the project overview

## 🚀 Ways to Contribute

We look for focused, high-impact contributions. Your help can fall into these key areas:

| Contribution Area | Focus | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model Improvement** 🧠 | Core AI/ML logic, Model Architectures, Algorithms (Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch). | Increase prediction accuracy, optimize model speed, or reduce training time. |
| **Data & Datasets** 📊 | Sourcing, cleaning, or labeling farming data (e.g., crop diseases, soil types). | Expand the model's knowledge base and real-world applicability. |
| **New Features** 💡 | Implementing new features (e.g., automated irrigation, pest detection module). | Add powerful, practical tools for farmers. |
| **Code Maintenance** 🧹 | Refactoring, bug fixes, dependency updates, ensuring clean Python standards. | Keep the codebase fast, clean, and secure. |
| **Documentation** 📝 | Guides, explanations, API docs, usage examples. | Make the project easy for both developers and users (farmers) to understand. |

## 💡 Quick Start Checklist

To ensure your contribution is merged smoothly, please follow these steps:

1.  **Check Issues** 👀: For major changes or new features, **please open an issue first** to discuss your approach.
2.  **Claim Your Task** 🙋: If you plan to work on an existing issue, **comment on it** to let others know you've claimed it.
3.  **Fork and Branch** 🌳: Fork the repository, clone your fork locally, and create a new branch for your work (e.g., `feat/disease-model` or `fix/sensor-read`).

## 🛠️ Development & Testing: The Essentials

### Mandatory Testing 🧪

Since we deal with AI models, stability and accuracy are critical. Any code contribution **must** be verified.

1.  **Unit Tests:** For core functions (e.g., data processing, API handling), add or update unit tests in the appropriate `tests/` directory.
2.  **Model Validation:** If you modify a core model, you must report **metrics** (e.g., accuracy, loss, F1 score) in your PR to confirm the model's performance has not degraded.
3.  Ensure all tests pass before submitting your Pull Request. **No passing tests, no merge!** 

### Code Style

Please adhere to standard Python best practices (PEP 8), and keep all dependencies updated in your `requirements.txt` (or `pyproject.toml`).

### Local Development Setup & Pre-commit

To ensure code quality and consistent formatting, this project uses `pre-commit` hooks. These hooks run automatically every time you make a commit to check for linting errors and reformat your code.

#### One-Time Setup

After cloning the repository and setting up your virtual environment, please install the development dependencies and then install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Install all development requirements, including pre-commit
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install the git hooks
pre-commit install

## 🤝 Submitting Your Pull Request (PR)

1.  **Scope:** Keep your PR focused on a single logical change.
2.  **Title:** Use a clear, brief title that reflects the change (e.g., `feat: Add support for soil moisture sensor data`).
3.  **Description:** Explain **what** you changed and **why** it benefits the project. If you updated a model, include a summary of the performance metrics.
4.  **Hacktoberfest:** Feel free to mention your participation in Hacktoberfest!

Thank you for helping Farm-IQ grow! Happy coding! 🥳
